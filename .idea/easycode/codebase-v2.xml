    <option name="fileSummaryMaps" value="{&quot;/home/vitalii/Documents/Cources/Udemy/Docker/frontend&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;/src/index.js\&quot;:\&quot;This file is the entry point for a React application. It sets up the root of the application and renders the `App` component within a `React.StrictMode` component.\\n\\n`ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\\u0027root\\u0027))`: This function creates the root of the React application and attaches it to the HTML element with the ID \\\&quot;root\\\&quot;.\\n\\n`root.render(\\u003cReact.StrictMode\\u003e\\u003cApp /\\u003e\\u003c/React.StrictMode\\u003e)`: This function renders the `App` component within a `React.StrictMode` component, which helps identify potential issues in the application.\\n\\n`reportWebVitals()`: This function is commented out, but it is used to measure the performance of the web application and send the results to an analytics endpoint.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/index.css\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains CSS styles for a web application. It does not contain any classes or functions. Instead, it sets the default styles for the `body` and `code` elements.\\n\\n`body`: Resets the margin to 0, sets the font family to a list of system fonts, and enables font smoothing.\\n\\n`code`: Sets the font family for code elements to a monospace font.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/App.js\&quot;:\&quot;This file does not contain any classes. It contains the following function:\\n\\n`App`: This function returns a React component that displays the React logo, a message that says \\\&quot;I was changed!\\\&quot;, and a link to the React website.\\n\\nThe file also imports the React library, the React logo image, and a CSS file for styling the application.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/setupTests.js\&quot;:\&quot;This file does not contain any classes or functions. It is importing the `jest-dom` library, which adds custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes. This allows the developer to perform more specific and expressive assertions on DOM elements during testing, such as checking for the presence of certain text content or attributes.\&quot;,\&quot;/package.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file appears to be a `package.json` file, which is a configuration file used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies, scripts, and other project-related settings. It does not contain any classes or functions, but rather a set of key-value pairs that describe the project\\u0027s metadata, dependencies, and scripts.\\n\\nThe file does the following:\\n\\n1. Defines the project\\u0027s name, version, and that it is a private project.\\n2. Lists the project\\u0027s dependencies, including React, testing libraries, and web-vitals.\\n3. Defines the available scripts for the project, such as starting the development server, building the production version, running tests, and ejecting the project from the Create React App setup.\\n4. Configures the ESLint settings for the project.\\n5. Specifies the target browsers for the production and development environments.\&quot;,\&quot;/public/manifest.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file appears to be a JSON configuration file for a React application. It does not contain any classes or functions, but rather defines the metadata and configuration settings for the application. Here\\u0027s a summary of the key elements in the file:\\n\\n`\\\&quot;short_name\\\&quot;`: Provides a short name for the application.\\n`\\\&quot;name\\\&quot;`: Provides a longer, more descriptive name for the application.\\n`\\\&quot;icons\\\&quot;`: Defines the various icons to be used for the application, including a favicon and two larger icons for different screen sizes.\\n`\\\&quot;start_url\\\&quot;`: Specifies the starting URL for the application.\\n`\\\&quot;display\\\&quot;`: Indicates that the application should be displayed in standalone mode.\\n`\\\&quot;theme_color\\\&quot;`: Defines the primary color theme for the application.\\n`\\\&quot;background_color\\\&quot;`: Defines the background color for the application.\\n\\nThis file is typically used by a web server or a web browser to configure the application\\u0027s metadata and appearance, such as the application\\u0027s name, icons, and theme colors.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/reportWebVitals_1.js\&quot;:\&quot;This file does not contain any classes. It contains the following functions:\\n\\n`reportWebVitals`: This function is responsible for reporting web vitals, which are a set of metrics that measure the performance of a web page. It imports the necessary functions from the `web-vitals` library and calls them with the provided `onPerfEntry` function as a callback.\\n\\nThe file exports the `reportWebVitals` function, which can be used in a web application to track and report on various performance metrics.\&quot;,\&quot;/public/index.html\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a standard HTML template for a React application. It does not contain any classes or functions. Instead, it sets up the basic structure and metadata for a React application, including:\\n\\n- Defining the HTML document structure with `\\u003chtml\\u003e`, `\\u003chead\\u003e`, and `\\u003cbody\\u003e` tags.\\n- Specifying the character encoding, viewport, and theme color for the application.\\n- Providing metadata about the application, such as the description and icons for mobile devices.\\n- Linking to the `manifest.json` file, which provides additional metadata for the application.\\n- Rendering the React application\\u0027s content within a `\\u003cdiv id\\u003d\\\&quot;root\\\&quot;\\u003e\\u003c/div\\u003e` element.\\n- Displaying a message for users who have JavaScript disabled.\\n\\nThe purpose of this file is to serve as the entry point for the React application, setting up the necessary HTML structure and metadata before the actual React code is loaded and executed.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/App.css\&quot;:\&quot;This file appears to be a CSS stylesheet for a React application. It defines the styles for various elements of the application, including the main app container, the app logo, and the header. There are no explicit functions defined in this file, but there are several CSS classes with the following summaries:\\n\\n`.App`: Applies styles to the main app container, centering the text.\\n\\n`.App-logo`: Applies styles to the app logo, including an animation that rotates the logo infinitely.\\n\\n`.App-header`: Applies styles to the app header, including a background color, centering the content, and setting the font size.\\n\\n`.App-link`: Applies a color style to links within the app.\\n\\n`@keyframes App-logo-spin`: Defines an animation that rotates the app logo from 0 degrees to 360 degrees.\\n\\nOverall, this file sets the visual styles for the React application, including the layout, colors, and animations.\&quot;,\&quot;/package-lock.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file appears to be a package.json file for a React project called \\\&quot;frontend\\\&quot;. It lists the dependencies and devDependencies required for the project, including testing libraries, React, and other utilities. There are no classes or functions defined in this file. The purpose of this file is to manage the project\\u0027s dependencies and provide information about the project.\&quot;,\&quot;/README.md\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a documentation for the Create React App project, which is a popular tool for setting up a React development environment. It provides an overview of the available scripts and their functionalities, as well as information about code splitting, bundle size analysis, progressive web app development, advanced configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting. The file does not contain any classes or functions, but rather serves as a guide for developers who are getting started with Create React App.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
